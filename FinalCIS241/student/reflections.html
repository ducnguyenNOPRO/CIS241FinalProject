                <h1>What I've learned from this class</h1>
                <p>
                    This class is a greate introduction for people who have no experience
                    in Web development. This class teaches you a somewhat about overall 
                    web development and focuse mainly on HTML and CSS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For me, this class is a great refresh of HTML and CSS since I've already
                    learned about them through Freecodecamp. It also helps me strengthen some of
                    my CSS weakness like flexbox and position.
                </p>
                <h1>My "Ah ha" moment</h1>
                <p>
                    My first biggest "Ah ha" moment is when I finally understand <strong>flexbox layout</strong>.
                    I figured out the differences between "align-items" and "justify-contents" attributes. "align-items"
                    are used to align flex items along the cross-axis while the justify-contents are used to flex items 
                    along the main axis
                </p>
                <p>
                    My second biggest "Ah ha" moment is understanding <strong>margin and padding</strong>. When
                    I first started learning about CSS, I tried to learn as many things as possible
                    but it costed my by lowering my understanding on how those things actually work.
                    Two of those things are margin and padding. After taking this class, I took my time
                    to go slowly but steadyly and I finally understand the use of margin and padding.
