                <h1>About me</h1>
                <p>My name is Duc Nguyen. I'm currently doing the AA in computer science
                - DTA. I plan to transfer to a university and get a bachelor's degree
                in computer science. By the time of this course, I've already applied for UW Bothell.
                    I'm taking my Java 3 class to finish my AA degree.
                </p>

            <section class="i-tried grid-start-text scale-up">
                <h1 style="color:yellow">What I've studied</h1>
                <p style="color:white">
                    During my time at Edmonds, I've tried out many different area of technology field. I've tried game development
                    with Unreal Engine for about 3 months, and it was really hard. When talking about 
                    game development, the language used to program a game is usually C++ or C# but for Unreal
                    Engine, they use C++. C++ is difficult, I took a C class before and it really confuse me 
                    when talking about pointer, struct, etc. So, if C is hard then C++ must be twice harder.
                <br>
                <br>
                    I've also tried Web Development in the freecodecamp.org website before taking this class. 
                    I also quit after 2-3 months because it's just not my interest area. The reason I take this 
                    class is I just want to have a solid knowlege about the front-end stuff. And I'm more like a 
                    back-end guy, writing "magic code" behind the scence.

                <h1>What I didn't know</h1>
                <p>
                    Before pursuing this CS degree, I didn't know that this field has many programs. Such as 
                    Web Application and Cloud Developer, Cyber Defense and Digital Forensics or Computer Information 
                    Systems, etc. I would probably changed my major if I am able to start over.
